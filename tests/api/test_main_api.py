# Example of how to run these tests:
# 1. Ensure `pytest`, `httpx`, and `fastapi` are in requirements.txt and installed.
# 2. Navigate to the project root in your terminal.
# 3. Run the command: `pytest`
#
# Notes for running API tests:
# - Environment Variables: The FastAPI application (`src.api.main.app`) might require
#   environment variables to be set to initialize services (like OpenAI, Supabase clients).
#   If these are not set, importing `app` might fail or tests might not behave as expected.
#   Consider using a `.env.test` file and `python-dotenv` (or `pytest-dotenv`) to manage
#   test-specific configurations.
# - Mocking Services: For true integration tests of API endpoints without hitting external
#   services, you would typically mock the service dependencies of your FastAPI app.
#   This can be done using FastAPI's dependency overrides feature.
#   For example, mocking `ConversationService` for endpoints that use it.
#   The /health endpoint is simple and usually doesn't have external dependencies.
# - Database State: If API tests interact with a database, ensure a consistent DB state
#   for each test run (e.g., by using a test database, transactions, or data fixtures).
#   The /health endpoint typically does not interact with the DB.
